# Vehicle Parking Management System

This is a web-based application developed for managing vehicle parking. It allows users to register vehicles, assign parking spots, and manage entry and exit times.

## Requirements

- PHP >= 7.4
- MySQL
- Apache server (e.g., XAMPP for Windows or LAMP for Linux)
- Composer (for dependency management)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azeemmaniyar/Vehicle-Parking-Management-System.git
cd Vehicle-Parking-Management-System
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use Composer to install the required dependencies.

```bash
composer install
```

## Database Setup

1. **Create a Database:**
   - Create a new database in MySQL (e.g., `vehicle_parking_db`).
   
2. **Import Database:**
   - Import the SQL file located in the `database` folder (e.g., `database.sql`) into your database.

3. **Configure Environment:**
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
   - Update database credentials in the `.env` file:

     ```plaintext
     DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
     DB_DATABASE=vehicle_parking_db
     DB_USERNAME=root
     DB_PASSWORD=your_password
     ```

## Running the Application

### On Linux

1. **Start the LAMP Server:**
   - Start Apache and MySQL services. On Ubuntu, run:
     ```bash
     sudo service apache2 start
     sudo service mysql start
     ```

2. **Set Permissions (if necessary):**
   - Set permissions for the project folder to allow Apache access:
     ```bash
     sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/Vehicle-Parking-Management-System
     ```

3. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/Vehicle-Parking-Management-System`.

### On Windows

1. **Start XAMPP:**
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL.

2. **Move Project to XAMPP's `htdocs`:**
   - Copy the project folder (`Vehicle-Parking-Management-System`) to `C:\xampp\htdocs`.

3. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/Vehicle-Parking-Management-System`.

## Troubleshooting

- **404 Not Found:** Ensure the server is running and that you've entered the correct URL.
- **Database Errors:** Double-check your `.env` settings and ensure the database is correctly imported.
